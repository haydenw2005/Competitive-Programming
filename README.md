# Competitive Programming

Welcome to my **Competitive Programming** repository! This repo contains my solutions to various coding problems from different platforms (mainly Kattis), which vary in content by week.

## üõ†Ô∏è About the Repository

This repository is designed to:

- Showcase my progress in competitive programming.
- Provide a collection of solutions to problems I've solved across various platforms (e.g., Kattis, LeetCode, etc.).
- Include helpful algorithms and templates for future use.

Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, or use it as a reference for your own competitive programming practice!
